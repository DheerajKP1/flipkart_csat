    "# Project Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Context\n",
    "\n",
    "In the highly competitive e-commerce space, delivering excellent customer service is crucial for sustaining growth and customer loyalty. **Flipkart**, as one of the largest e-commerce platforms, focuses on enhancing customer satisfaction to differentiate itself from competitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this project captures customer interactions, feedback, and satisfaction scores across various support channels at Flipkart. By analyzing these interactions, the goal is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify key drivers of customer satisfaction  \n",
    "- Understand performance across different customer service teams  \n",
    "- Develop strategies to improve the overall service experience  \n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the factors that influence customer satisfaction enables Flipkart to resolve customer issues faster and tailor support strategies to meet diverse customer expectations. This directly helps in optimizing agent performance and improving satisfaction metrics such as the **CSAT score**, ultimately leading to increased brand loyalty and customer retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify key drivers of customer satisfaction (important features)\n",
    "- Develop a predictive model to estimate the **Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT)**\n",
    "- Propose strategies to improve the overall customer service experience\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset **`Customer_support_data.csv`** contains multiple records from a customer support system. Each row represents a unique customer interaction, along with metadata such as agent details, response time, product information, and the final satisfaction score.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Target Variable**: CSAT Score  \n",
    "- **CSAT Range**:  \n",
    "  - 1 → Very Dissatisfied  \n",
    "  - 5 → Very Satisfied  \n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective is to leverage the available features to accurately predict the CSAT score and gain insights into service quality.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Real-World Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "- Develop a system to **predict customers who need immediate query resolution**\n",
    "- Identify customers who are **most likely to give low CSAT scores**\n",
    "- Enable **live monitoring of service quality**\n",
    "- **Flag at-risk interactions** in real time\n",
    "- Identify **issue types, agents, or teams** contributing to poor satisfaction\n",
    "- Gain a deeper understanding of data patterns and feature importance\n",
